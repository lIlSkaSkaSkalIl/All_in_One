# Google Colab Code Snippets Collection

This repository contains a collection of Python code files designed to be used directly in **Google Colab**.  
Each file may contain one or more code sections labeled as **Cell 1**, **Cell 2**, etc. These sections must be copied and pasted into **separate cells** in Colab to ensure proper execution.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open a new [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. For each file in this repository:
   - Open the file.
   - If the file contains **Cell 1, Cell 2, ...**, copy each block into its own separate cell in Colab.
   - If there is no cell label, copy the entire file into a single Colab cell.
3. Run the cells in the correct order (Cell 1 → Cell 2 → Cell 3, etc.).

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

- Each file corresponds to a standalone script or utility.
- Files with multiple labeled cells (`Cell 1`, `Cell 2`, …) must be split accordingly in Colab.

Example:

```text
example_script.py
 ├─ Cell 1 → Paste into Colab Cell #1
 ├─ Cell 2 → Paste into Colab Cell #2
 └─ Cell 3 → Paste into Colab Cell #3
```

## 📝 Notes

- Make sure to **run the cells in order** for dependencies to be properly initialized.
- Some scripts may require additional setup (e.g., installing Python packages).  
  Instructions, if needed, will be included inside the script.
- If you encounter errors, double-check that you did not paste multiple labeled cells into the same Colab cell.

## 🤝 Contribution

Feel free to fork this repository, suggest improvements, or contribute additional Colab-ready scripts.  
When adding new files, please:
- Use clear **Cell 1/2/3** labels if the script requires multiple cells.
- Add inline comments to guide users.
